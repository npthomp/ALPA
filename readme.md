# ALPA
## Transcribed from *Machine Language for the Absolute Beginner* (Melbourne House, 1984).

This is a working version of the ALPA (Assembly Language Programming Aid) utility. The original printed listing in the book is difficult to read due to font size and print quality.

I have transcribed the code and verified it line-by-line against the checksums provided in the book, using the program's built-in checksum algorithm.

Given the hours of work it took to transcribe this program and then fix typos, I'm sharing my work here to save time for anyone else with the book.
